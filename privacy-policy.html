<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Moxy ("we", "us", "our", or "the App") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application. By using Moxy, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
<p>Moxy stores the following data exclusively on your device using local storage. This data is never transmitted to our servers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your first name (provided during onboarding)</li>
  <li>Anxiety type selections, frequency, triggers, and goals</li>
  <li>Mood check-in history and mood entries</li>
  <li>Journal entries</li>
  <li>DARE session and grounding session completion records</li>
  <li>App preferences (notification settings, reminder time, language)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We do not have access to this data.</strong> It exists solely on your device and is not backed up to any server operated by us.</p>

<h3>1.2 Subscription and Purchase Data</h3>
<p>If you purchase a subscription or in-app purchase, payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We use RevenueCat, a third-party service, to manage subscription status and entitlements. RevenueCat may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An anonymous user identifier (generated automatically, not linked to your personal identity)</li>
  <li>Purchase and subscription status information</li>
  <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID. For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>1.3 Notifications</h3>
<p>If you enable daily reminders, notification scheduling is handled locally on your device using the operating system's notification system. We do not use push notification servers and do not collect notification tokens.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>We want to be clear about what we do not collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect personal health or medical data</li>
  <li>We do not collect your location</li>
  <li>We do not collect analytics or usage tracking data</li>
  <li>We do not use cookies or web tracking technologies</li>
  <li>We do not collect email addresses, phone numbers, or contact information</li>
  <li>We do not collect device identifiers for advertising purposes</li>
  <li>We do not share or sell any data to third parties</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>The locally stored data is used solely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide personalized app experiences (e.g., greeting you by name, tailoring DARE exercises to your selected mood)</li>
  <li>Display your mood and journal history within the app</li>
  <li>Track your progress over time</li>
  <li>Schedule local notification reminders at your chosen time</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>All personal data is stored locally on your device using the operating system's secure storage mechanisms. Since we do not transmit or store your data on external servers, your data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including device encryption and passcode/biometric locks.</p>
<p>If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data will be permanently deleted.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Subscription management. Processes anonymous purchase data. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
  <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> — Payment processing. Governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Moxy is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> You can delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the App. Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling permanently removes it.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable or disable notifications at any time through the App's settings or your device's system settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel subscriptions through your Apple ID settings in the App Store.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p><strong>Moxy is not a medical application and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</strong> The App provides general wellness and self-help content related to anxiety management techniques. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, psychological counseling, therapy, or any form of healthcare.</p>
<p>You should always consult a qualified healthcare professional for medical or mental health concerns. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact emergency services or a crisis helpline in your area immediately.</p>
<p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</li>
  <li>We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</li>
  <li>We shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the App, including but not limited to damages for loss of data, emotional distress, personal injury, or any health-related outcomes.</li>
  <li>Your use of the App and reliance on any content or techniques provided therein is solely at your own risk.</li>
  <li>In no event shall our total liability exceed the amount you paid for the App or subscription in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
